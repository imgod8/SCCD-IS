# SCCD-IS
This repo holds code and resources for Spectral-Consistent Cross-Display Image Standardization (SCCD-IS), which standardizes visual/non-visual light effects for cognitive experiments.

Introduction: The study proposes the SCCD-IS framework to standardize image spectral properties for cognitive experiments. It unifies visual and non-visual light effects, overcoming the limitation of current methods focusing only on visual luminance.

Methodology: Includes two phases: calibration-based acquisition of the relationship between display grayscale and spectral irradiance, and code-based image conversion for standardization.

Evaluation: Metrics quantify standardization errors and structural similarity between pre - and post - processed images. Results show SCCD-IS outperforms HIST - M in accuracy and semantic feature preservation.

Potential Applications: The framework can enhance reproducibility in vision science and display - dependent human - computer interaction studies.
